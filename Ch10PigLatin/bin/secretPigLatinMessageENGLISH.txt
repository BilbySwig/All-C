and the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake

and thats what they dont see

i make the moves up as i go 
and thats what they dont know 
thats what they dont know 

but i keep cruising 
cant stop wont stop grooving 
its like i got this music 
in my mind 
saying its gonna be alright 

cause the players gonna play play play play play 
and the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
